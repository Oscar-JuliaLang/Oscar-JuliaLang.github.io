## Who is this for?
Anyone interested in OSCAR and JuliaLang, especially people who want to learn collaboratively and build reusable notes.

## Do I need to be an expert?
No. Bringing questions is a feature, not a bug.

## How do I contribute notes?
Add or edit Markdown files under `notes/`. If you add a new note, also add a link in `notes/index.md`.

## What if I only have a small fix?
Small fixes are welcome — typos, clarifications, extra links, better explanations.

## What tools do we use?
- GitHub for notes and discussion
- Julia + OSCAR for hands-on exploration
(We’ll add more specifics as the group converges on a workflow.)
