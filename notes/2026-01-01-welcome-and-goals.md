## TL;DR
- Set expectations for the reading group
- Agree on a lightweight workflow for notes
- Collect topic ideas for OSCAR + Julia

## Goals for the group
- Learn OSCAR and Julia by reading docs/papers and running small experiments
- Produce concise notes that are easy to reuse
- Keep a running FAQ for common setup and conceptual questions

## Suggested session format (flexible)
1. Context (5–10 min)
2. Main topic (20–30 min)
3. Hands-on example (10–20 min)
4. Discussion + next steps (10 min)

## Proposed topics (starter list)
- Julia basics for scientific computing: environments, packages, reproducibility
- OSCAR overview: what it includes, how it fits into the ecosystem
- Algebraic geometry / commutative algebra workflows in OSCAR
- Performance patterns in Julia (types, allocations, benchmarking)
- Writing small reusable scripts/notebooks for experiments

## Open questions
- What cadence works best (weekly / biweekly)?
- Should we rotate “session lead” roles?
- Do we want a “beginner track” and an “advanced track”?
