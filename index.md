title: OSCAR and JuliaLang Reading Group
---

## What we are doing
We are a reading group at the **University of Leeds** focused on **OSCAR** and **JuliaLang**, with an emphasis on learning by reading, reproducing small examples, and building shared notes that are useful to newcomers and regular attendees alike.

Our sessions typically combine:
- a short overview of the topic of the week,
- discussion of key ideas and trade-offs,
- a small hands-on component (code snippets, demos, or exercises),
- and a list of open questions for follow-up.

## Why we are doing it
OSCAR and Julia have a rapidly growing ecosystem for computational mathematics and scientific computing. The goal of this group is to:
- build shared understanding of the tools and the underlying concepts,
- lower the barrier to entry for people who want to use them in research,
- and create a set of **high-quality, searchable notes** and **FAQs** that live beyond a single meeting.
