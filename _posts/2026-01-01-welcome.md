title: "Welcome to the OSCAR and JuliaLang Reading Group"
---

We’re starting a reading group at the University of Leeds focused on **OSCAR** and **JuliaLang**.

This website will host:
- session notes,
- short updates,
- and a growing FAQ.

If you’d like to join or suggest a topic, open an Issue in this repo with a short note about your interests.
