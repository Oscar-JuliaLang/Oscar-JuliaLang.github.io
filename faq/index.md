## Who is this for?
Anyone interested in OSCAR and JuliaLang, especially people who want to learn collaboratively and build reusable notes.

## Do I need to be an expert?
No.

## How do I contribute notes?
Add or edit Markdown files under `notes/`. If you add a new note, also add a link in `notes/index.md`.

## What if I only have a small fix?
Small fixes are welcome — typos, clarifications, extra links, better explanations.

## What tools do we use?
- GitHub for notes and discussion
- Julia + OSCAR for hands-on exploration
(We’ll add more specifics as the group converges on a workflow.)

## How do I download Julia + OSCAR on a (Windows) university laptop?
- Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
OSCAR works best in a Linux environment. On a university-managed laptop, you may need to contact the IT service desk to have WSL installed. We recommend installing Ubuntu (as the distribution) following the steps [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- Install Julia + OSCAR inside WSL.
Follow the rest of the steps [here](https://www.oscar-system.org/install/win/) to complete the installation of OSCAR. This shouldnt require any aditional permissions or support from IT.
