# OSCAR × JuliaLang Reading Group (University of Leeds)

This repository hosts the public-facing website for the OSCAR × JuliaLang Reading Group at the University of Leeds.

We use it for:
- **Lecture-style notes** from each session
- **Weekly updates** (blog posts)
- A living **FAQ**
- Links, resources, and suggestions for future topics

## Website
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the site will be available from the repo’s Pages URL (Settings → Pages).

## Organizers / initial contributors
